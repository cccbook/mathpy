## Maxwell's equations

1. Gauss's law for electricity: $\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$
2. Gauss's law for magnetism: $\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0$
3. Faraday's law of induction: $\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{l} = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$
4. Ampere's law: $\oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0 I + \mu_0 \epsilon_0 \frac{d\vec{E}}{dt}$

where $\vec{E}$ is the electric field, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\vec{A}$ is the surface area, $Q$ is the electric charge, $\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, $\vec{l}$ is the path length, $\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux, $I$ is the current, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, and $t$ is time.
