List important Maxwell's Equations Set
Maxwell's equations are a set of four equations that describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. They are:

Gauss's law for electricity: the flux of the electric field through any closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed within the surface.

Gauss's law for magnetism: the flux of the magnetic field through any closed surface is equal to zero.

Faraday's law of induction: the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a closed circuit is equal to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the circuit.

Ampere's law: the total current passing through any surface is equal to the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the surface.

These equations form the foundation of classical electrodynamics and are used to describe the behavior of electric and magnetic fields in various contexts, including electricity and magnetism, electromagnetism, and electrical engineering.
